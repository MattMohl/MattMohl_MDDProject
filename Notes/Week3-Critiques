Previous:

1. Branding needs work. Drop Shadows are too strong. They need to be less intense. A little goes a long way is what Gus would say. Blue border (line) below main image is too thick and needs a lighter color to make itself more effective. Look at the border lines between stories on Pivotal Tracker as an example.
2. Userflow needs some improvements. Try changing the main image when the page changes.
3. MVC looks good
4. There is a jquery script in your vender file.
5. Lots of bloated JS files. Need to consider optimization!

Critique

1. More comments would be a good idea.

2. The code looks great to me, otherwise, as well as the design. I can't test due to a localhost problem, but the main page looks good, with the facebook login.

Previous:

	1. The login doesn't track user types for admin or others.
    2. File structure can still be cleaned up a lot check out (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18542353/angularjs-folder-structure)
    3. Add some extra padding for the bottom of the logo when shrunk down to mobile.


Critique

1. Great designing, I wish I could see the rest of the site!
	- My localhost breaks your code for some reason, so I'll just critique the homepage

2. I would put some more padding on the text when on lower resolutions

3. Also, I would make the hovers making the nav work on-clicks if at all possible
