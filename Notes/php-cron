PHP :: cron

I'll need to use what is known as a 'cron job' to execute my background api calls as well as sms communication. I found a great article about this at:

	http://www.sitepoint.com/introducing-cron/

	and here

	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto



cron syntax:

	1. Open a new cron file like this -> crontab -e

	2. Then, write a command to run a certain file like this -> 

		* 2 * * * /localhost/Site/php/script.php

	with the syntax

		[minutes] [hours] [date] [month] [day] "command"
